# NYC SAT Analysis

## About the Project

This is a practice project from DataCamp.  
The goal is to analyze NYC schools’ SAT results using Python and Pandas.

I practiced:

- Loading and cleaning data
- Filtering and sorting results
- Grouping data and calculating statistics (mean, standard deviation, count)
- Thinking like a real data analyst, not just coding

---

## What I Did

1. Found the schools with the best math scores (80% or more of the max score)  
2. Selected the top 10 schools by total SAT score (math + reading + writing)  
3. Found which NYC borough has the biggest variation in SAT results (highest standard deviation)

## What I Learned

- How to work with real data using Pandas  
- How to group data and analyze it step by step  
- How to answer real business questions using data analysis  
- I overcame my fear of `groupby` and learned how to work with `agg()`
